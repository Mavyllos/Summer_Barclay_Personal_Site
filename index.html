    <h1>Hey there!</h1>
    <p>To (badly) paraphrase the Rolling Stones: Please allow me to introduce myself, I am a woman of no wealth and peculiar taste. I mean seriously, have you met my husband? Ha! I kid, I kid. (Sorry my love.)</p>
      <p>In all seriousness, my name is Summer and I am thrilled to be starting this new adventure with all of you. Feel free to click <a href="Myself.html">here</a> to learn more about me or <a href="Mygoals.html">here</a> to learn about my goals for this program.</p>
